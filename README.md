# MyReads-A-Book-Tracking-App
React MyReads: A Book Tracking App<br>
This is a project for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. To make a book tracking app by React.

# How to Use
The project is based on Node.js and the Create-React-App.<br>
So that you need to download Node.js at the following link: https://nodejs.org/en/ <br>
After that you can download my project at https://github.com/Lihoiyin/MyReads-A-Book-Tracking-App <br>
or enter this command in your terminal <br>
```
git clone https://github.com/Lihoiyin/MyReads-A-Book-Tracking-App.git
```
Next, install npm or yarn and start <br>
```
npm install
npm start

   or
   
yarn install
yarn start
```
Finally, the website will be generated autoly.

## Planning Stage
Step 1 - Draw All of the Views of the App<br>
You can also try to use <a href="https://codingsans.com/blog/mockup-tools">software for creating mockups</a>.  <br>
<br>
Step 2 - Break Each View Into a Hierarchy of Components<br>
For this step,<br>
- draw boxes around every component; and<br>
- arrange our components into a hierarchy<br>
<br>
Step 3 - Determine the Data Each Component Needs<br>
For each component, determine which data is the component accessing, getting, modifying, or showing.<br>
<br>
Step 4 - Determine Which Component Each Piece of Data Should Live in<br>
If multiple components need the same data, lift the state up by storing the data in the components' closest common ancestor. <br>
Take a look at these example to see how that's done: <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html">Lifting State Up</a> and <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html">Thinking in React</a>.<br>
<br>

## Coding Stage
Step 1 - Create components that hold data.<br>
Build all of the components that hold data and make sure everything works correctly, <br>
including API calls (e.g. the components request data the correct way and the data comes in as expected.)<br>
<br>
Step 2 - Create components that need data.<br>
<br>
Step 3 - Pass data from components that have it to components that need it.<br>
<br>
Step 4 - Debug and make sure that everything works as expected.<br>
<br>
Step 5 - Add inverse data flow (if you're confused about what that means, take a look at <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html">this</a>.<br>
<br>
Step 6 - Add navigation.<br>
<br>
Step 7 - Add finishing touches and make sure the project meets the<a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view">rubric</a>.
